Universal Hybrid Container Fields for FileMaker



### What is it:

Universal Hybrid Container a Design Pattern we have been successfully using in production for many years in projects of all sizes. It helps to mitigate the problems and potential risks storing binary data inside a FileMaker database. It does that by completely excluding container fields from the rest of the database into one or more separate database files. 

#### It's universal

Whether you have a lot of different container fields all over your app's tables (like profile pictures, PDF documents, email attachments etc.) and would like to store them in just one binary table 

#### It's hybrid

Do you prefer internal, external or encrypted storage for your binaries? All have there advantages and disadvantages. 



### What can it do:



### What it is not:

#### Clustering
